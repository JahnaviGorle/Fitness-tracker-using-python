#🏋️‍♂️ Fitness Tracker using Python
A Streamlit-based web application that predicts the number of kilocalories burned based on user input parameters such as Age, BMI, Exercise Duration, Heart Rate, and Body Temperature.

📌 Features 🚀
✔️ User-friendly interface using Streamlit
✔️ Predicts calories burned using Random Forest Regression
✔️ Accepts user inputs such as Age, BMI, Exercise Duration, Heart Rate, and Body Temperature
✔️ Compares user stats with similar past data points
✔️ Displays similar calorie-burning cases for reference
